### Another kind of distcc
This is a variant of the original distcc, based on version 2.18.3 (just before the introduction of the "pump" functionality), refactored into C++.

It allows to easily add support for compilers other than GCC (currently supports Microsoft C/C++ and Wind River Diab compilers).

Building **distcc** requires the **Freemason** build system.
